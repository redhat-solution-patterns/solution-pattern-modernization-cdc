// tag::about[]

This solution pattern brings an architectural solution for scenarios where services integration must happen through data integration and cause no impact to the existing stack.

The architecture demonstrates how *https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-change-data-capture[Change Data Capture (CDC)]* design pattern and event-driven architectures supports the *extension of existing capabilities with no changes to legacy apps* where new features can be delivered by cloud-native microservices and can deliver with *zero impact new search capabilities* through the integration of legacy and new services with specialized search index services.
