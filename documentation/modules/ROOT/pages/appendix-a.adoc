=== Components configuration

All the customization of the services is externalized using OpenShift secrets. As an example, let's check the connection information for the *cashback-connector* service.

1. Navigating to *Workloads -> Deployments -> cashback-connector => YAML*, the following configuration section can be visualized:

2. In order to find out exactly which configuration values are being used by the *cashback-connector* service, let's take a look at the configured secret. On the left menu navigate to *Workloads -> Secrets*
3. In the filter, search by the name `cashback-connector` and select the secret:
+

4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on *Reveal values*, located in the Data section.
*  The parameters you used in your Ansible provisioning inventory was used by Helm charts in order to generate these final values, which are a mix of default template values, plus your custom configuration.
* This service is configured to:
** Connect to the Kafka bootstrap server;
** Subscribe to the topics `retail.sale-aggregated` and `retail.updates.public.customer`;
** Be a publisher of events on the topic `retail.expense-event`;
** Connect to the *cashback-db*, a postgresql database;
