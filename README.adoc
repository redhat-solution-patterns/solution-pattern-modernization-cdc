== Solution patterns site template 

This is a template used to generate new solution pattern pages with the same look and feel of the existing solution patterns and https://redhat-solution-patterns.github.io/[main page] .

* <<How to create a new solution pattern page>> 
* <<Development Quickstart>>
** <<Clone and install the new project>>

=== How to create a new solution pattern page

To create a new solution pattern page:

. Access to https://redhat-solution-patterns.github.io/courseware-template;
. Click on the `Use this template` green button;
. Type the name of your new sp, e.g. "solution-pattern-xy-z".
* It's recommended that you are the owner of the repository during the initial phases of development;
. Click on the `Create repository from template` green button
You should have a new repository with the required files and configurations to get started with content development.

=== Development Quickstart

This section offers a basic tutorial to teach you how to set up the generated project, and preview it locally. A more comprehensive can be found in the documentation at docs.antora.org.

==== Prerequisites
To preview and bundle the default UI, you need the following software on your computer:

* git (command: git)
* Node.js (commands: node and npm)
* Gulp CLI (command: gulp)

===== Node.js

In this guide, we'll be installing Node.js 10.

While you can install Node.js from the official packages, we strongly recommend that you use {url-nvm}[nvm] (Node Version Manager) to manage your Node.js installation(s).
Follow the {url-nvm-install}[nvm installation instructions] to set up nvm on your machine.

Once you've installed nvm, open a new terminal and install Node.js 10 using the following command:

 $ nvm install 10

You can switch to this version of Node.js at any time using the following command:

 $ nvm use 10

To make Node.js 10 the default in new terminals, type:

 $ nvm alias default 10

Now that you have Node.js installed, you can proceed with installing the Gulp CLI.

===== Gulp CLI

You'll need the Gulp command-line interface (CLI) to run the build.
The Gulp CLI package provides the `gulp` command which, in turn, executes the version of Gulp declared by the project.

You should install the Gulp CLI globally (which resolves to a location in your user directory if you're using nvm) using the following command:

 $ npm install -g gulp-cli

Verify the Gulp CLI is installed and on your PATH by running:

 $ gulp --version

Now that you have the prerequisites installed, you can fetch and build the UI project.

=== Clone and install the new project

1. Clone the generated project using git.
2. Use npm to install the project's dependencies inside the project.
In your terminal, execute the following command:

 $ npm install

=== Run and preview the website

To build and preview the project in a local web server, run:

 $ npx gulp

You'll see a URL listed in the output of this command:

Navigate to this URL to preview the site locally.

While this command is running, any changes you make to the source files will be instantly reflected in the browser.

Press `[Ctrl+C]` to stop the preview server and end the continuous build.

=== How to add my new solution pattern to the main page menu

To have your solution pattern listed in the top menu, please open a new issue in
https://github.com/redhat-solution-patterns/course-ui/issues[this project: https://github.com/redhat-solution-patterns/course-ui/issues].

Make sure to inform:

* Short title
* Main category (if appropriate). e.g. "Application modernization", "Edge", etc.
